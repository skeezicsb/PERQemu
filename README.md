# PERQemu
### An emulator for the Three Rivers Computer PERQ workstation

  Please see **PERQemu/Readme.txt** for the general Readme distributed with the release.

  For those interested in the implementation details, **PERQemu/Readme-source.txt** has all the nitty.  And the gritty.


### The Boondoggle Variations

- `skeezicsb/master` tracks the original `jdersch/PERQemu` master branch;

- `skeezicsb/main` contains stable snapshots of my local release builds that may or may not have been folded back into the original _PERQemu_ repository;
  
- `skeezicsb/experiments` is work-in-progress and may at any time be broken, buggy or just weird - but lots of fun stuff happens there. :-]

For the latest updates see [ChangeLog.txt](https://github.com/skeezicsb/PERQemu/blob/experiments/PERQemu/ChangeLog.txt).
