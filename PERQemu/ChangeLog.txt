PERQemu "experiments" branch ChangeBlog


Summary of changes on the development branch since the v0.6.5 interim release.
Previous notes moved to ChangeLog-Old.txt.


January, 2025:

    2. Fixed the floppy DMA handling that was causing grief with the EIO Z80.
    This is a testing snapshot to try out some other small fixes (24-bit) and
    incorporate some PERQmedia tweaks that help with loading dodgy POS floppies.
    Bumped the UserGuide.pdf as well.  Still working toward building a couple
    of Micropolis and MFM disk images with demos and games and goodies as well
    as other fixes for a v0.7.x release.  Real Soon Now.  Really.

    1. Bumped the copyright notices and version number to v0.6.6 to snapshot at
    the start of the new year.  Reassessed and reviewed the state of the world
    (sheer horror) and the code base (looking up) and am resolved to get to v1.0
    before the year is out, or die trying.
